# Project Overview

Welcome to the AutoComplete Text Box project! This application implements a sophisticated auto-complete feature by fetching and displaying data from the Rick and Morty API. The choice of the Rick and Morty API was deliberate, as it offers simplicity, is free to use, and provides a lightweight dataset, making it ideal for sample projects.

## Running the Project

To launch the project, follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies using the command:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. Start the project:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Testing the Project

After successfully starting the project, open your browser and navigate to `localhost:3000`. You will encounter a user-friendly interface featuring a text input.

### AutoComplete Functionality

As you begin typing in the text input, the application dynamically generates search suggestions. Clicking on any suggestion will simulate navigation by refreshing the page.

For optimal results, try searching using the following terms:
- "Rick"
- "Morty"
- "Smith"

The search bar is designed to be scrollable, ensuring a seamless user experience when dealing with an extensive list of suggestions.

## Code Review

While crafting the codebase, certain elements may appear unused. However, these intentional additions contribute to enhanced component reusability and ease of integration into real-world projects.

Additionally, explanatory comments have been strategically placed throughout the code to provide clarity on specific implementation details. These comments aim to facilitate a smooth review process and foster a deeper understanding of the codebase.

Feel free to explore the codebase, and if you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to reach out.
